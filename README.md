# Grava-Fun
An educational 2D platformer project under unity development for my graduation.


GravaFun is a project that meant to be a learning journey and a never stopping development for the content as a hobby of making video games,
content of the game was inspired by alot of famous games but the connection between levels is completely my own, that started as my graduation project from my universtiy as a BSC in software engineering.

Grava fun is a 2D platformer that mainly focuses on teaching the simple physics for a specific age genre, with quite a balance between the entertainment and the learning factors.

project was well documented and its code was completely explained from line to line, there will be a folder with all the project source files and codes, to be directly run under unity platform, and there will be an excutable file that runs on linux, windows and OS, for testing and experimenting.

there will be a complete document explaining the concept behind it and som detailed explanation to the most attractive codes between scripts that later on i will spot the light on due to the fact that some scripts can be used in a wide range of projects for different purposes and it was written for this purpose actually.
